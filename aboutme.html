      <h2>Why Programming</h2>
      <p> I've had a very interesting and creative life though just like may others I found myself perhaps a little lost
        and needing direction. It was at this point I discovered coding through my partner and uncle who have made very
        sucessful careers out of it through graduating at Coder Academy. As a 28 year old I'd like to now follow in
        their footsteps and pursue a career as a software engineer.</p>

      <h2> Education</h2>
      <p>I have graduated university, and as a result can speak and understand Japanese. I have also learnt the basics
        and some advanced concepts of HTML and CSS and am about to learn Python, JavaScript
        and many more programming languages.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>

      <p>My hobbies include gaming, spending time with family, going places with my dogs/partner and doing
        art. Below are examples of pen art. <br> The interseting thing about pen art is that you can never take back a
        mark you make, so the imperfections become the final art. </p>
